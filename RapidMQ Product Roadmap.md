WSJF Analysis of Key Features
To prioritize our development efforts, we'll use the Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) method. WSJF is calculated as: (Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction/Opportunity Enablement) / Job Size

Scoring criteria (1-10 scale):
- Business Value (BV): Impact on customer satisfaction and business goals
- Time Criticality (TC): Urgency of implementation
- Risk Reduction/Opportunity Enablement (RR/OE): Potential to reduce risks or enable new opportunities
- Job Size (JS): Effort required for implementation (inverse scale: 10 = smallest job, 1 = largest job)
