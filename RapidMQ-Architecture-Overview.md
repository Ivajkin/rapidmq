# RapidMQ Architecture Overview

## 1. Introduction

RapidMQ is a high-performance, distributed message queue system designed for scalability and reliability. This document provides a high-level overview of RapidMQ's architecture.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 Message Broker
- Central component for message routing and storage
- Handles message persistence and distribution
- Implements pub/sub and point-to-point messaging patterns

### 2.2 Producer API
- Client library for applications to send messages
- Supports multiple programming languages (e.g., Java, Python, Go)
- Handles connection management and message serialization

### 2.3 Consumer API
- Client library for applications to receive messages
- Supports multiple programming languages
- Manages subscriptions and message acknowledgments

### 2.4 Cluster Manager
- Coordinates multiple broker instances
- Manages data replication and partition leadership
- Handles broker failure and recovery

### 2.5 Storage Engine
- Optimized for high-throughput, low-latency operations
- Supports both in-memory and disk-based storage
- Implements efficient indexing and retrieval mechanisms

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1 Distributed Architecture
- Horizontally scalable across multiple nodes
- Supports partitioning for parallel processing

### 3.2 Fault Tolerance
- Replication of messages across multiple nodes
- Automatic failover and recovery mechanisms

### 3.3 Message Persistence
- Configurable persistence levels (in-memory, disk, replicated)
- Write-ahead logging for crash recovery

### 3.4 Security
- TLS encryption for client-broker communication
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms

### 3.5 Monitoring and Management
- Built-in metrics and health checks
- RESTful API for system management

## 4. Data Flow

1. Producer sends message to Broker
2. Broker persists message to Storage Engine
3. Broker routes message to appropriate partition
4. Consumer pulls message or receives via push notification
5. Consumer acknowledges message receipt

## 5. Scalability Considerations

- Brokers can be added to increase throughput
- Partitions allow for parallel processing of topics
- Consumers can be grouped for load balancing

## 6. Integration Points

- Supports standard protocols (AMQP, MQTT)
- Provides REST API for management and monitoring
- Offers plugins for popular data processing frameworks (e.g., Apache Kafka Connect)

## 7. Deployment Options

- On-premises deployment
- Cloud-native deployment (Kubernetes)
- Managed service offering (future roadmap item)

This architecture provides RapidMQ with the foundation for high performance, scalability, and reliability, positioning it as a robust solution for enterprise messaging needs.
