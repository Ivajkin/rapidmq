# RapidMQ Store-and-Forward Specification

## Jobs to be Done (JTBD)

1. Enable message persistence during network outages
2. Ensure message delivery in unreliable network conditions
3. Optimize bandwidth usage in constrained environments
4. Maintain message order and integrity across disconnections
5. Provide seamless integration for applications in edge computing scenarios

## User Stories and Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Edge Node Message Storage

As an IoT device manufacturer,
I want RapidMQ to store messages locally when the network is unavailable,
So that no data is lost during connectivity issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Messages are stored locally in a SQLite database when the network is unavailable
- Stored messages include topic, payload, timestamp, and status
- The local storage has a configurable maximum size to prevent overwhelming the device
- Messages are stored in order of arrival

### 2. Automatic Message Synchronization

As a system administrator,
I want edge nodes to automatically sync stored messages with the main broker when the connection is restored,
So that I don't have to manually manage data transfer.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Edge nodes attempt to sync with the main broker at configurable intervals
- Successfully synced messages are marked as 'sent' in the local database
- The sync process is resilient to interruptions and can resume where it left off
- Sync attempts use exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the network or broker

### 3. Message Ordering Preservation

As a data analyst,
I want messages to be processed in the order they were generated, even after network outages,
So that I can accurately analyze time-sensitive data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Messages include timestamps from when they were originally generated
- The main broker processes synced messages based on their original timestamps
- Consumers receive messages in the correct order, regardless of when they were synced

### 4. Bandwidth Optimization

As a field operations manager,
I want RapidMQ to optimize bandwidth usage during synchronization,
So that we can operate efficiently in areas with limited connectivity.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Messages are batched during synchronization to reduce overhead
- The batch size is configurable to adapt to different network conditions
- Compression is used for message payloads during synchronization
- The system prioritizes newer messages if bandwidth is limited

### 5. Edge Node Configuration

As a DevOps engineer,
I want to easily configure edge nodes with their sync settings and broker information,
So that I can quickly deploy and manage a distributed messaging system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Edge nodes can be configured with a unique ID, broker URL, and sync interval
- Configuration can be done via environment variables or a config file
- Changes to the configuration can be made without losing stored messages
- The system provides a way to view the current configuration of an edge node

### 6. Monitoring and Reporting

As a network administrator,
I want to monitor the sync status and health of edge nodes,
So that I can proactively address any issues in the messaging system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The main broker provides an API to query the status of connected edge nodes
- Edge nodes report their sync statistics (success rate, last sync time, pending message count)
- Alerts can be configured for edge nodes that haven't synced in a specified timeframe
- A dashboard is available to visualize the overall health of the edge node network

### 7. Message Expiration and Cleanup

As a system architect,
I want old or successfully synced messages to be automatically cleaned up on edge nodes,
So that we can manage storage efficiently on constrained devices.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Successfully synced messages are removed from edge node storage after a configurable period
- Messages can have an expiration time, after which they are deleted even if not synced
- A cleanup process runs periodically to remove expired or old synced messages
- The cleanup process does not interfere with ongoing message storage or sync operations

### 8. Seamless Producer API Integration

As an application developer,
I want to use the same Producer API whether I'm connected directly to the broker or using an edge node,
So that I can write consistent code regardless of the deployment scenario.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The Producer API has the same method signatures for direct broker and edge node scenarios
- The API automatically handles message storage and forwarding based on the current configuration
- Developers can easily switch between direct broker and edge node modes with minimal code changes
- The API provides feedback on whether a message was sent immediately or stored for later sync

This specification provides a comprehensive guide for implementing store-and-forward capabilities in RapidMQ, addressing key needs for edge computing and IoT scenarios with intermittent connectivity.
